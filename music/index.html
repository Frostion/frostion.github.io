				<h1>my favorite albums</h1>
				<p>Music is my favorite form of media. I've never really been into TV or films, and it's a challenge to get me to actually commit to playing a game, but I'll happily sit through entire albums at a time. I'm mostly drawn to 90s and 2000s electronic music (don't call it EDM) but will occasionally branch out into indie pop and other related genres.</p>
				<p>Here's a list of some of my favorite albums in alphabetical order (a ✨ icon indicates my all-time favorites). Click on a thumbnail to listen to the album (usually on Bandcamp or YouTube). If you happen to like any of these albums, I highly recommend getting them on CD or vinyl (or just burn your own CD or MD if you can't find an official release). Music is best experienced on dedicated, physical media.</p>

						<h3>✨ Onoken - Swell Strings (2003)</h3>
						<p>Uhhh this is probably one of (if not the) best electronic music albums of all time? It's got the best trance you'll ever hear, the best dnb you'll ever hear, and it's all tied together with beautiful orchestral compositions and vocal sections. I highly recommend dedicating an hour to just listening to this album from start to finish.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div>

						<p>If you're interested in trance but don't know where to start, this is the album for you! It exposes you to a wide variety of styles and artists, so you're sure to find something that you like in here! (Also, please get the CD - the booklet is full of fantastic late 90s graphic design.

						<p>Masterfully minimal soundscapes crafted solely with the beautiful, pure tones of a <a href="https://www.vintagesynth.com/casio/cz-5000">Casio CZ-5000</a> synthesizer. This is the album to play if you need something chill to relax and refresh your mind with.</p>

					<div>
						<a target="_blank" href="https://sheofficial.bandcamp.com/album/coloris"><img src="she-coloris.jpg"></a>
						<h3>✨ she - Coloris (2008)</h3>
						<p>An entire sci-fi universe contained within a single album. High-energy, high-tech, digital funk chiptune rock pop all at once. I first bought this album around when it was released over 10 years ago and it's been one of my all-time favorites ever since then - it <i>never</i> gets old.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div>
						<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msQ1-SJEad0"><img src="stormfromtheeast2.jpg"></a>
						<h3>Storm From The East 2 (1997)</h3>
						<p>Intelligent dnb that will nourish your digital soul. An excellent compilation of some of the best that dnb has to offer.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div>
						<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rz3JVZbmoCg"><img src="transcentralconnection.jpg"></a>
						<h3>Trans-Central Connection (1996)</h3>
						<p>Same thing as Storm From The East - another excellent compilation of the best intelligent dnb around. Both are equally good in my opinion.</p>

						<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49knEXlbX-0"><img src="virtualself.jpg"></a>
