			<p><b>What are you even? </b>A frosty jackal who loves Pokémon, plushies, weird electronic musical things, and Arduino. I'm in need of other cool furs to talk to so message me on <a href="http://t.me/frostion">Telegram</a> if you want!</p>
			<p><b>What even is the point of this site? </b>I originally wanted a place I could dump all of my electronics and programming projects, but it was just too much work to make good documentation for those things (and I'm really lazy). Now this site is just for Pokémon plushie stuff, I guess.</p>
			<p><b>Why does this site keep changing its look? </b>I'm never satisfied. The current look is pretty nice, but I like designing new interfaces so it could drastically change again in the future.</p>

			<h2 id="favorites">My favorite things because why not</h2>
			<h3>Music-related stuff</h3>
			<p><b>Favorite band/artist: </b>Either Neon Indian or Chad Valley. Both are deliciously weird and synthy so it's hard to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Favorite song: </b>Arcade Blues by Neon Indian</p>
			<p><b>Favorite synth: </b>Axoloti. It's tiny, cheap, and can be literally any synth you want it to be, as long as you can program it.</p>
			<h3>Gaming</h3>
			<p><b>Favorite retro console: </b>Probably Super Nintendo, because of its amazing game library (Super Mario World, Star Fox, F-Zero, Zelda: A Link to the Past, you get it).</p>
			<p><b>Favorite retro game: </b>Star Fox 64. A bit more enjoyable than the original because it isn't as impossibly difficult, and it runs at an acceptale framerate. Or maybe Mario Paint is better. It all depends.</p>
			<p><b>Favorite modern console: </b>Wii U. Even though it didn't sell well for some reason, it's still really cool and a great example of Nintendo's creativity. I almost picked the Wii because of its game library, but the Wii U is backwards compatible, so you can still play Wii games on it. I think of the Switch more as a portable console, so I didn't pick it here.</p>
			<p><b>Favorite handheld console: </b>I can't decide between the 3DS, the Game Boy Advance, or the Switch. The 3DS is another great example of Nintendo creativity, and it has a huge library full of great games (and a couple great synths from Korg too!). Plus, it has the best D-pad and analog nub I've ever felt (and it comes in a really good shade of purple). The Game Boy Advance also has an amazing library, though, and it was the console that defined my childhood so it's hard to decide. I had my first Pokémon experience on the GBA, which makes it really special to me. The Switch absolutely nails the 'portable home console' thing, but it's way too early to judge its library. All the different ways the Joycons can be used is pretty rad.</p>
			<p><b>Favorite modern game: </b>I can't pick one, so I'll just list all of my favorites in no particular order: Minecraft, Mario Kart 8 DX, Super Mario Galaxy 2, Super Paper Mario, MegaMan Battle Network 5 & 6, Pokémon Sun/Moon, Pokémon Sapphire/Ruby, Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team.</p>
			<h3>Pokémon stuff</h3>
			<p><b>Favorite Pokémon: </b>It changes a lot. It is currently Lucario, but used to be Eevee. Before that it was Froslass, I think.</p>
			<p><b>Favorite Pokémon plushie: </b>My huge custom-made Lucario. He's gigantic, adorable, and super cuddly. My little Mega Lucario is pretty great as well, because he's small enough that I can take him everywhere with me.</p>
			<p><b>Favorite Pokémon game: </b>I can't decide between Pokémon Sun/Moon, Pokémon Sapphire/Ruby, or Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team. They're all fantastic games.</p>
			<p><b>Favorite Pokémon generation: </b>Third, probably because my first Pokémon game was Sapphire (or maybe it's just because its the best generation).</p>
			
			<h2 id="nope">Things that I don't really like</h2>
			<p><b>Pokémon Mystery Dungeon - Gates to Infinity: </b>This game had amazing potential, simply because it was Mystery Dungeon on a 3DS. Combining the best game series ever with the best handheld ever - how could it fail? I don't know, but it did. The entire game feels like it was made to appeal to a <i>much</i> younger audience than the previous games, which means it ended up being extremely easy, uninspired, and boring, and the story was so watered down that it was sickening. This was probably one of the most disappointing things I've ever experienced. They should've just done a 3D remake of Red Rescue Team. That would've been pretty fresh.</p>
			<p><b>Pokémon Go: </b>The biggest dissapointment that has ever happened to humanity. Like everyone else in existence, this had me extremely excited for many months...but for some reason the worst game developer ever was allowed to make it. It's such a soulless husk of a game, and the wasted potential makes me genuinely sad. Nintendo's other mobile games are solid and very polished, so why did they give what could've been the best thing to ever happen to mobile gaming to a notoriously bad developer?</p>
			<p><b>Anniversary Pikachu plushie: </b>There's this one Pikachu that's at Walmart, and it's supposed to be some limited-edition anniversary thing. Unlike the anniversary Arceus (which I have, and it's wonderful), this Pikachu is disgustingly ugly. It's a really pale sickly yellow, and it has little yellow and gold Pikachu shapes all over it. From a distance, those shapes look like some horrifying skin disease. No thanks.</p>
			<p><b>Funko Pops and similar figures: </b>Funko Pops have ruined almost all vinyl figures for me. Every character, no matter how unique, is reduced to this generic little shape with a grotesquely large rectangular head. They all look exactly the same and are devoid of any creativity whatsoever. It wouldn't be so bad if they didn't infect almost every other vinyl figure maker out there - now everyone's making boring, generic figures with disproportionate heads. Even some of Tomy's recent plushies are getting heads that are too large, which offends me on a deep level. Nintendo's Amiibo (Amiibos? idk what the plural is) are the only good figures left anymore.</p>
			<p><b>Sergals: </b>I don't want to offend any sergals out there (please don't kill me!), but your noses are just too pointy! :P
			
			<h2 id="interests">My Interests</h2>
			<p><b>Plushies: </b>When I was young, I had a bunch of plushies I enjoyed much like any other child, but it wasn't something I would call an interest of mine until just a few months ago. I had seen an Espeon plushie at the Walmart near my house and was compelled to get it for some reason (maybe because it was the only Pokémon plushie there at the time). It became my life goal to get all the Eeveelutions after that moment, which I just recently accomplished (every store around me that sold Pokémon plushies rarely restocked them, so it took me longer than it should have). After seeing Mega Lucario on Tomy's website, I expanded my reach to any and all Pokémon plushies. I've also benn trying to learn how to make my own plushies, because a couple of Tomy's Eeveelutions were a bit disappointing.</p>
			<p><b>Sound and music synthesis: </b>For most of my life I've been trying to make musical stuff. I started using my grandparents' silly Casio keyboard, moved to MadTracker when I was in middle school, and eventually learned what synths are and how music actually works. Once I learned about synths, sculpting sounds became much more interesting to me than making music. I still try to make music, but it's just an excuse to mess around with synths and make new sounds.</p>
			<p><b>Electronics: </b>Around age 6 is when I first started trying to make electronic circuits. My first finished project was a blue light that turned on when you flicked a switch. The light and switch were mounted to a piece of sheet metal I salvaged from an old keyboard, and the metal was screwed into two pieces of wood to keep it off of the ground. My dream at the time was to make a big grid of lights that could be controlled by a big grid of switches on the back. For Christmas, I got Snap Kits and the Electronics Learning Lab from Radioshack (back when they sold actual electronics (and still existed)), which allowed me to build circuits that actually did stuff. Around age 12, I got an Arduino starter kit, which allowed me to make even fresher stuff. I still use Arduinos all the time today in projects. Pretty much all of my projects now make weird sounds and/or visuals.</p>
			<p><b>Retro games: </b>No idea when or how this started. I guess I just like older games better or something. Got a Nintendo 64 when I was like 9 or 10 I think, just because there were cool games for it. I was always a fan of the Game Boy/Color/Advance series. The GBA is still probably my favorite console (or maybe the Super Nintendo is). Who knows.</p>
			<p><b>Programming and computers: </b>When I was in 1st grade, my school was in the process of upgrading from their old Macs that ran something like OS 8 or 9. They got rid of them by having a raffle, and I won one. Having my own computer that I could mess up as much as I wanted to started my interest. Later on, I got a Gateway 2000 that ran Windows ME (ech), and I used my dad's laptop that ran Windows XP regularly to teach myself the basics of programming. Those two computers put up with a lot of crap from me. Things like PowerPoint, Kid Pix, the screensavers part of Control Panel, and whatever poorly-written programs I found on Software USA CDs were my favorite things to mess around with. Eventually, the Gateway 2000 just gave up on life one Sunday morning and refused to boot into Windows ever again. I started out programming by using Game Maker and eventually taught myself some Python. So far, my favorite language to use is C, but I'm starting to not hate Visual Basic too.</p>
