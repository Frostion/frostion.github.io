					<h1>about me</h1>
					<img class="float" style="width:24%;" src="frosticon.jpg"></img>
					<p>i'm frost, a pink inflatable dragon who's obsessed with keeping technology, design, and music from the late 90s and early 2000s alive and in use. if you come across a guy with a neon green cybiko, a neon purple MD walkman, and an absolute brick of a feature phone, then you've probably found me!</p>
					<p>for as long as i can remember, i've always been interested in computers, electronics, and making stuff. as a kid, i was constantly screwing up the family computer with customization software from shareware CDs, disassembling every old device i could get my paws on, and building random circuits with radioshack electronics kits (the radioshack electronics learning lab was always my favorite). nowadays, i still love tinkering with tech and making stuff, and i've expanded into digital art, graphic design, photography, and PC programming. i still occasionally make stuff with electronics and microcontrollers, but i've been focusing more on art and software projects lately.</p>
					<p>even though a large amount of my friends are furries and i occasionally get dragged along to furry events with them, i'm not a furry myself - i'm just a dragon. i tried to be a part of the furry community for a few years, but it was honestly a terrible experience that i don't want to repeat or be associated with.</p>
					<p>if you've visited my <a href="/art/">art gallery</a>, then you've probably deduced that i have a bit of a mystical/spiritual perspective on computers, software, and technology in general. to me, computers aren't just tools - they're gateways to entirely new, impossibly complex, and endlessly fascinating creative universes that operate completely differently from our own physical reality. we can't directly experience the computer's universe, but we can use them as interfaces for exploring, learning about, and interacting with it.</p>
					<p>in the universe of the computer, the only limit is your imagination, and with the help of computers, your imagination can become limitless.</p>
					<p>if you want to contact me, you can <a href="https://t.me/frost_sheridan">poke me on telegram</a>, or <a href="https://vrchat.com/home/user/usr_a2408ac6-31db-488c-a30f-c4c5e5d0d227">add me on vrchat</a> if you want to hang out sometime!</p>
