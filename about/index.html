			<h2>Some Unimportant Info</h2>
			<p><b>What are you even? </b>A frosty jackal who loves Pok√©mon, plushies, weird electronic musical things, and Arduino. I'm in need of other cool furs to talk to so message me on <a href="http://t.me/frostion">Telegram</a> if you want!</p>
			<p><b>What even is the point of this site? </b>I originally wanted a place I could dump all of my electronics and programming projects (but I haven't actually added any projects yet :P).</p>
			<p><b>Why does this site keep changing its look? </b>I love designing new interfaces and color schemes and stuff, so this site's design is constantly in flux. I also wanted it to have a slightly cleaner and more professional look, which I have hopefully achieved with the current design.</p>
			<p><b>What specs does your PC have? </b><a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Frostion/saved/MJCLkL" target="_parent">Click here</a> for a parts list.</p>

			<h2>I should add more info here sometime about my hobbies and interests and favorite things and stuff...<h2>
