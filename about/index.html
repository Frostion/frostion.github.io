			<h2 id="things" align="center">Some Various Things</h2>
			<p><b>What are you even? </b>My name is Aaron Rennie. I make noise as a hobby, and I do CAD stuff (making and fixing blueprints and 3D models) as a job. You can find out more about me in the sections below.</p>
			<p><b>Why doesn't this site look like 90s vomit anymore? </b>After seeing the <a href="http://trixel.io" target="_parent">trixel.io</a> website, I was inspired by how smooth and crisp everything looked. I was tired of my site looking like absolute garbage, so I'm in the process of remodeling it. For the third time. (I even use the exact same background gradient as trixel.io but don't tell anybody!)</p>
			<p><b>What is your <i>least</i> favorite plushie? </b>There's this one Pikachu that's at Walmart, and it's supposed to be some limited-edition anniversary thing. Unlike the anniversary Arceus (which I have, and it's wonderful), this Pikachu is disgustingly ugly. It's a really pale sickly yellow, and it has little yellow and gold Pikachu shapes all over it. From a distance, those shapes look like some horrifying skin disease. No thanks.</p>

			<h2 id="interests" align="center">My Interests</h2>
			<p><b>Synthesis: </b>Synthetic sound effects and weird visuals have always been fascinating to me. (I used to think that sound synthesis was just hand-drawing waveforms when I was really young.) In 6th grade (~12 years old), I joined band in school. It was the thing that kick-started my interest in music, but I quit the next year because there was no creating involved, just playing back already-made music the exact same way it was written down. I played around with iPad apps like GarageBand for a long time, and loved playing with the synth settings more than anything. I got my first synth (Korg Volca Keys) my sophomore year of high school, and soon after that, got a Casio CZ-1000 (my favorite so far) and a slew of other little Korg boxes. At the same time, my interest in Arduinos and electronics was developing too, so the next step was to combine the two and start making my own hardware synths, which is the way my synth interest manifests itself most prominently today. I never really ended up making music though.</p>
			<p><b>Electronics: </b>Around age 6 is when I first started trying to make electronic circuits. My first finished project was a blue light that turned on when you flicked a switch. The light and switch were mounted to a piece of sheet metal I salvaged from an old keyboard, and the metal was screwed into two pieces of wood to keep it off of the ground. My dream at the time was to make a big grid of lights that could be controlled by a big grid of switches on the back. For Christmas, I got Snap Kits and the Electronics Learning Lab from Radioshack (back when they sold actual electronics (and still existed)), which allowed me to build circuits that actually did stuff. Around age 12, I got an Arduino starter kit, which allowed me to make even fresher stuff. I still use Arduinos all the time today in projects. Pretty much all of my projects now make weird sounds and/or visuals.</p>
			<p><b>Retro games: </b>No idea when or how this started. I guess I just like older games better or something. Got a Nintendo 64 when I was like 9 or 10 I think, just because there were cool games for it. I was always a fan of the Game Boy/Color/Advance series. The GBA is still probably my favorite console (or maybe the Super Nintendo is). Who knows.</p>
			<p><b>Programming and computers: </b>When I was in 1st grade, my school was in the process of upgrading from their old Macs that ran something like OS 8 or 9. They got rid of them by having a raffle, and I won one. Having my own computer that I could mess up as much as I wanted to started my interest. Later on, I got a Gateway 2000 that ran Windows ME (ech), and I used my dad's laptop that ran Windows XP regularly to teach myself the basics of programming. Those two computers put up with a lot of crap from me. Things like PowerPoint, Kid Pix, the screensavers part of Control Panel, and whatever poorly-written programs I found on Software USA CDs were my favorite things to mess around with. Eventually, the Gateway 2000 just gave up on life one Sunday morning and refused to boot into Windows ever again. I started out programming by using Game Maker and eventually taught myself some Python. So far, my favorite language to use is C, but I'm starting to not hate Visual Basic too.</p>
			<p><b>Old music and video formats: </b>I mostly got into this kind of stuff because the thrift stores around me always have good albums and movies on cassettes, vinyl, and VHS tapes, so I ended up getting some machines to play those formats on. I just started, so my collection is still tiny and sad.</p>

			<h2 id="life" align="center">Philosophy and Life Stuff</h2>
			<p><b>Philosophy: </b>I don't really have any kind of formal life philosophy; it's just the standard stuff that involves not being awful to other people.</p>
			<p><b>Religious/spiritual views: </b>This is a topic I don't like to talk about much, but here we go anyways. If you asked me a few years ago what my religious beliefs were, I would probably have some rude, snarky answer about how religion is stupid or something like that. I've become a less awful person since then, and have actually thought about religion and spirituality instead of just instantly writing it off as being useless crap. Currently, I would describe myself as being somewhat animistic.</p>
