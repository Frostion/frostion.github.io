			<h1 style="margin-top: 1em;">Some Unimportant Info</h1>
			<p><b>What are you even?</b> I'm Frost, an icy fluffy jackal who loves weird electronic musical things. I'm in need of other cool furs to talk to so message me on Telegram or Discord if you want! (Warning: I am extremely awkward and really bad at keeping conversation going...)</p>
			<p><b>Why does this site keep changing its look?</b> I love designing new interfaces and color schemes and stuff, so this site's design is constantly in flux. I also wanted it to have a slightly cleaner and more professional look, which I have hopefully achieved with the current design.</p>
			<p><b>What specs does your PC have?</b> <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/user/Frostion/saved/MJCLkL" target="_parent">Click here</a> for a parts list for my desktop. My laptop is an Asus ROG GL702VSK.</p>
			
			<h1>Hobbies and Interests</h1>
			<p><b>Synth things:</b> Unlike most people who do synth things, I just find making sound itself interesting. I rarely make music. Most of what I do is design DIY synth design, whether it's an analog circuit, something Arduino-based, or a program for the Axoloti.</p>
			<p><b>Programming and electronics:</b> Most of the things that I make are synths in some way, but I occasionally branch out into other projects as well. I mostly make things with Arduino, but I've tried things like Game Maker for PC as well (and I'm really bad at it).</p>

			<h1>Things I Like</h1>
			<h3>Music</h3>
			<p><b>Favorite artist:</b> Neon Indian or Keep Shelly In Athens</p>
			<p><b>Favorite song:</b> Too many to pick, but if I had to pick <i>one</i>, it would be Terra by Lemmino</p>
			<p><b>Favorite album:</b> Any by Neon Indian - I can't decide on just one!</p>
			<h3>Game Things</h3>
			<p><b>Favorite console game:</b> Super Mario Galaxy 2</p>
			<p><b>Favorite portable game:</b> Megaman Battle Network series</p>
			<p><b>Favorite PC game:</b> Sorry... but probably Minecraft...</p>
			<p><b>Favorite game console:</b> Definitely the Game Boy Advance. I think I spent my <i>entire</i> childhood on my GBA.</p>
			<p><b>(to be expanded later)</b> </p>
			
			<h1>My Hardware Music Things</h1>
			<h3>(in order from most to least favorite, not including my DIY stuff)</h3>
			<p><b>1. Axoloti:</b> This is the MOST AMAZING SYNTH THING EVER! Completey reprogrammable and can become any kind of synth or effect unit or anything you can think of, as long as you can program it. Like an audio Arduino but so much better.</p>
			<p><b>2. Casio CZ-1000:</b> An unmistakably 80s digital synth with a surprising amount of warmth and versatility. Sounds amazing through chorus.</p>
			<p><b>3. Digitech Polara:</b> I <i>love</i> reverb. I use it on literally everything. Every mode on this is fantastic, and it adds a ton of stereo spread to any sound.</p>
			<p><b>4. Digitech Nautila:</b> Much like the Polara, this pedal adds a ton of stereo spread, but I like reverb just a bit more than chorus.</p>
			<p><b>5. Korg Kaossilator 1:</b> A super fun little box for sketching out musical ideas and just making silly noises. My favorite portable synth I own.</p>
			<p><b>6. Kastle:</b> A fun and super deep timewaster, but I can't see myself ever using this for actual music. For the price though, it's a lot of fun!</p>
			<p><b>7. Mooer Ninety Orange:</b> This is definitely not a <i>bad</i> pedal, but I rarely use it and I don't think I would miss it much if I sold it.</p>
