								<h1>about me</h1>
								<p>i'm frost, a pink inflatable dragon who's obsessed with keeping technology, design, and music from the late 90s and early 2000s alive and in use. if you come across a guy with a neon green cybiko, a neon purple MD walkman, and an absolute brick of a feature phone, then you've probably found me!</p>
								
								<h2>computers & tech</h2>
								<p>in the universe of the computer, the only limit is your imagination, and with the help of computers, your imagination can become limitless.</p>
								
								<p>for as long as i can remember, i've been interested in computers, electronics, and making stuff. as a kid, i was always screwing up the family computer with janky software from shareware CDs, disassembling everything i could get my paws on (usually destructively), and learning electronics and microcontrollers with radioshack kits.</p>
								
								<p>nowadays, i still love tinkering with tech and making stuff, although lately i've been focusing more on <a href="/art/">art</a> and <a href="/projects/">programming</a> instead of electronics and microcontrollers. my focus shifts pretty often, so i'll probably get back into that stuff sometime in the future.</p>
								
								<p>i <u>love</u> weird, obscure, and/or impractical tech from the late 90s and early 2000s, and i continue to use as much of it as possible to this day. a lot of my computing is done on a sony vaio PCV-W30, my favorite music format is minidisc, my cybiko handles PDA/organizer tasks, my most-used camera is a sony mavica, my TV is a massively thicc sony trinitron, and my most-played game consoles are the ps2 and dreamcast.</p>
								
								<p>i've been a citizen of virtual reality for a few years now - you can usually find me hanging out in vrchat (and occasionally neos) whenever i have free time. vr lets me be my true dragon self while hanging out with friends from across the globe, exploring impossible worlds beyond imagination, and transcending all limitations of physical reality and society. real life <i>really</i> sucks in comparison. :P</p>
								
								<h2>inflatables</h2>
								<p>in addition to computers and tech, inflatables have also always been a very important part of my life. i live with <a href="/pooltoys/">several other inflatable dragons</a> as one big family. just like humans, inflatables all have their own unique personalities, emotions, and interests (but they're way more cuddly than humans are). i'm pretty good at befriending and getting along with them, so i guess that makes me an inflatable whisperer of sorts?</p>
								
								<h2>idk other stuff</h2>
								<p>i have a bit of a mystical perspective on computers and technology, which finds its way into most of my creative projects. i feel that computers aren't [just] tools - they're gateways to entirely new, fascinating, complex universes that operate completely differently from our own reality. our physically-oriented minds can't even imagine what it's like to directly experience the world inside of computers.</p>
								
								<p>even though most of my friends are furries and i occasionally still get dragged along with them to furry events, i'm not a furry myself - i'm just a dragon. i <i>was</i> involved with the furry community for a few years, until i realized just how much of a negative impact it was having on my mental health and overall wellbeing. would not recommend.</p>
