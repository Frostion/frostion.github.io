			<h2 id="things" align="center">Some Various Things</h2>
			<p><b>What are you even? </b>My name is Aaron Rennie. I make noise as a hobby, and I do CAD stuff (making and fixing blueprints and 3D models) as a job. You can find out more about me in the sections below.</p>
			<p><b>Why doesn't this site look like 90s vomit anymore? </b>After seeing the <a href="http://trixel.io" target="_parent">trixel.io</a> website, I was inspired by how smooth and crisp everything looked. I was tired of my site looking like absolute garbage, so I'm in the process of remodeling it. For the third time. (I even use the exact same background gradient as trixel.io but don't tell anybody!)</p>
			<p><b>What is your <i>least</i> favorite plushie? </b>There's this one Pikachu that's at Walmart, and it's supposed to be some limited-edition anniversary thing. Unlike the anniversary Arceus (which I have, and it's wonderful), this Pikachu is disgustingly ugly. It's a really pale sickly yellow, and it has little yellow and gold Pikachu shapes all over it. From a distance, those shapes look like some horrifying skin disease. No thanks.</p>

			<h2 id="favorites" align="center">My favorite things because why not</h2>
			<h3>Music-related stuff</h3>
			<p><b>Favorite band/artist: </b>Either Neon Indian or Chad Valley. Both are deliciously weird and synthy so it's hard to decide.</p>
			<p><b>Favorite song: </b>Arcade Blues by Neon Indian</p>
			<p><b>Favorite synth: </b>Axoloti. It's tiny, cheap, and can be literally any synth you want it to be, as long as you can program it.</p>
			<h3>Gaming</h3>
			<p><b>Favorite retro console: </b>Probably Super Nintendo, because of its amazing game library (Super Mario World, Star Fox, F-Zero, Zelda: A Link to the Past, you get it).</p>
			<p><b>Favorite retro game: </b>Star Fox 64. A bit more enjoyable than the original because it isn't as impossibly difficult, and it still looks pretty good today. Or maybe Mario Paint is better. It all depends.</p>
			<p><b>Favorite modern console: </b>Wii U. Even though it didn't sell well for some reason, it's still really cool and a great example of Nintendo's creativity. I almost picked the Wii because of its game library, but the Wii U is backwards compatible, so you can still play Wii games on it.</p>
			<p><b>Favorite handheld console: </b>I can't decide between the 3DS or the Game Boy Advance. The 3DS is another great example of Nintendo creativity, plus it has a huge library full of great games (and a couple good synths from Korg too!). Plus, it has the best d-pad and analog pad I've ever felt (and it comes in a really good shade of purple). The Game Boy Advance also has an amazing library, though, and it was the console that defined my childhood so it's hard to decide. I had my first Pokémon experience on the GBA, which makes it really special to me.</p>
			<p><b>Favorite modern game: </b>I can't decide between MegaMan Battle Network 6, Pokémon Sun/Moon, Pokémon Sapphire/Ruby, or Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team.</p>
			<h3>Pokémon stuff</h3>
			<p><b>Favorite Pokémon: </b>It changes a lot. It is currently Lucario, but used to be Eevee. Before that it was Froslass, I think.</p>
			<p><b>Favorite Pokémon plushie: </b>What a surprise - it is the Mega Lucario that's part of the Tomy training plush series.</p>
			<p><b>Favorite Pokémon game: </b>I can't decide between Pokémon Sun/Moon, Pokémon Sapphire/Ruby, or Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team. They're all fantastic games.</p>
			<p><b>Favorite Pokémon generation: </b>Third, probably because my first Pokémon game was Sapphire (or maybe it's just the best generation).</p>
			
			<h2 id="interests" align="center">My Interests</h2>
			<p><b>Synthesis: </b>Synthetic sound effects and weird visuals have always been fascinating to me. (I used to think that sound synthesis was just hand-drawing waveforms when I was really young.) In 6th grade (~12 years old), I joined band in school. It was the thing that kick-started my interest in music, but I quit the next year because there was no creating involved, just playing back already-made music the exact same way it was written down. I played around with iPad apps like GarageBand for a long time, and loved playing with the synth settings more than anything. I got my first synth (Korg Volca Keys) my sophomore year of high school, and soon after that, got a Casio CZ-1000 (my favorite so far) and a slew of other little Korg boxes. At the same time, my interest in Arduinos and electronics was developing too, so the next step was to combine the two and start making my own hardware synths, which is the way my synth interest manifests itself most prominently today. I never really ended up making music though.</p>
			<p><b>Electronics: </b>Around age 6 is when I first started trying to make electronic circuits. My first finished project was a blue light that turned on when you flicked a switch. The light and switch were mounted to a piece of sheet metal I salvaged from an old keyboard, and the metal was screwed into two pieces of wood to keep it off of the ground. My dream at the time was to make a big grid of lights that could be controlled by a big grid of switches on the back. For Christmas, I got Snap Kits and the Electronics Learning Lab from Radioshack (back when they sold actual electronics (and still existed)), which allowed me to build circuits that actually did stuff. Around age 12, I got an Arduino starter kit, which allowed me to make even fresher stuff. I still use Arduinos all the time today in projects. Pretty much all of my projects now make weird sounds and/or visuals.</p>
			<p><b>Retro games: </b>No idea when or how this started. I guess I just like older games better or something. Got a Nintendo 64 when I was like 9 or 10 I think, just because there were cool games for it. I was always a fan of the Game Boy/Color/Advance series. The GBA is still probably my favorite console (or maybe the Super Nintendo is). Who knows.</p>
			<p><b>Programming and computers: </b>When I was in 1st grade, my school was in the process of upgrading from their old Macs that ran something like OS 8 or 9. They got rid of them by having a raffle, and I won one. Having my own computer that I could mess up as much as I wanted to started my interest. Later on, I got a Gateway 2000 that ran Windows ME (ech), and I used my dad's laptop that ran Windows XP regularly to teach myself the basics of programming. Those two computers put up with a lot of crap from me. Things like PowerPoint, Kid Pix, the screensavers part of Control Panel, and whatever poorly-written programs I found on Software USA CDs were my favorite things to mess around with. Eventually, the Gateway 2000 just gave up on life one Sunday morning and refused to boot into Windows ever again. I started out programming by using Game Maker and eventually taught myself some Python. So far, my favorite language to use is C, but I'm starting to not hate Visual Basic too.</p>
			<p><b>Old music and video formats: </b>I mostly got into this kind of stuff because the thrift stores around me always have good albums and movies on cassettes, vinyl, and VHS tapes, so I ended up getting some machines to play those formats on. I just started, so my collection is still tiny and sad.</p>
