					<h1>website history</h1>
					<p>while pushing an update to my website recently, i realized that because my site is hosted on a github repository, its entire history has been stored in the repo's commit history. i've wildly redesigned my website many, many times since i bought my first domain, so i thought it would be fun to revisit all those previous designs.</p>

					<h2>nov 2, 2016 - very first website</h2>
					<p>my first website ever! i had no idea how to write HTML or CSS, so i just embraced the 90s my-first-website look fully. the only links that worked were "about me" and "news".</p>

					<h2>feb 2, 2017</h2>
					<p>i started learning some basic CSS and layout principles, so i made something that looked a bit more "modern" (bland and boring). i developed a pokemon plushie hyperfixation around this time, so this site's main purpose was to host reviews and photos of my plushie collection. i also started getting interested in building my own synthesizers at this time.</p>

					<h2>jun 7, 2017</h2>
					<p>this major redesign occurred because i actually learned some CSS animation basics! i was <i>super</i> proud of those hover animations on the index page. to be fair to past frost, they are pretty cool. i also became a blue, icy, black-backed jackal at this time. (still a long way off from discovering my true dragon self, but at least i realized i wasn't human by now.)</p>

					<h2>mar 30, 2018</h2>
					<p>this entire page is just one long scrolling thing, which is actually sorta cool! it's missing a detailed "about me" section, which is somewhat of a downgrade.</p>

				<div>
					<h2>dec 10, 2018</h2>
					<p>at this time i thought that having a single, ever-lengthening, scrolling page would become too awkward if i added too much stuff to it, so i once again divided the sections up into their own separate pages. the detailed "about me" section hasn't returned yet, though.</p>
					<p>i was considering taking custom commissions for digital animated fursona badges at this point because so many people told me that They Would Totally Buy One, but i since decided against it because selling people hand-made electronic devices is not something i want to do.</p>

					<h2>apr 3, 2021</h2>
					<p>the actual layout of this site is very similar to my previous one, but the aesthetics have been MASSIVELY upgraded. check out those sick hexagons and rad fonts! i'm finally starting to find my style at this point.</p>

					<h2>feb 28, 2022</h2>
					<p>this iteration of my site occurred when i first heard about the "web revival" movement. it's by far the most "real" a website of mine has been up to this point.</p>
