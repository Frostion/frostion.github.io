					DO NOT PRONOUNCE IT AS "FROSTY-ON". That is incorrect and <i>very</i> annoying. Pronounce it <b>"Frost-shin"</b>, because of the way that "-tion" sounds. Think of the word "bastion" for inspiration. Why and how do so many people get this wrong?

					<font color="#00FFFF" size="5"><b>What are you even? </b></font>
					My name is Aaron Rennie, I'm 18 years old, and I do CAD things as a job (draw/fix blueprints and make 3D models). It's pretty rad. In my free time I make noise, make things that make noise, play old retro games, and poke Eeveelution plushies.

					You can email me at <b>aaron@frostion.online</b> or find/contact/stalk me on these sites: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuSdqbugbozZUJuzuDip0eA">YouTube</a> | <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/blog/frostion">Tumblr</a> | <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Frostion/">Reddit</a> (That's all for now, at least until I find more internet forums and stuff to join)

					<font color="#00FFFF" size="5"><b>Why does this site look like 90s vomit? </b></font>
					It is my 3rd favorite decade (1st being 80s and 2nd being 60s), and my 1st favorite decade when it comes to web design. Also I know like zero HTML and don't want to try to figure out how to put a WordPress site on GitHub Pages, and I haven't had any luck hosting my website at home. So here we are.

					<font color="#00FFFF" size="5"><b>What is your favorite still-functional HTML tag? </b></font>
					<marquee scrollamount="6" width="250">This one, obviously. Who doesn't love &lt;marquee&gt;? I would have chosen &lt;blink&gt;, but sadly, it's not supported any more. :(</marquee>
				</li>
				<li>
					<font color="#00FFFF" size="5"><b>WHat is your <i>least</i> favorite plushie? </b></font>
					There's this one Pikachu that's at Walmart, and it's suupposed to be some limited-edition anniversary thing. Unlike the anniversary Arceus (which I have, and it's wonderful), this Pikachu is disgustingly ugly. It's a really pale sickly yellow, and it has little yellow and gold Pikachu shapes all over it. From a distance, those shapes look like some horrifying skin disease. No thanks.
