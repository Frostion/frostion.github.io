					<h1>pool toy care</h1>
					<p>Pool toys and inflatables make for wonderful friends, and they're pretty easy to take care of too. In order to keep your squishy plastic friends happy and healthy, there are a few important things you should know.
					<hr>
					
					<h2>skin oils and plasticizer</h2>
					<p>Sadly, the natural oils that your skin produces are <i>really, really bad</i> for inflatables. If too much oil is left on them for any period of time, it will start to break down the chemical in their plastic that keeps them soft and flexible (known as plasticizer). If enough plasticizer leaches out, it will cause them to harden up and eventually become weak and brittle.</p>
					<p>To prevent this from happening, you need to stay vigilant about how much and what type of skin contact you have with them. The oils produced by your hands and limbs are pretty much harmless, but your face, chest, and hair can produce much more potent oils that <u>will</u> cause harm to them over time. The best way to avoid any issues is to take a thorough shower right before cuddling, especially if you're sweaty or just woke up. Otherwise, just make sure that any direct face/chest/etc. contact is kept to an absolute minimum.</p>
					<p>If you want to fall asleep with an inflatable, make sure that your skin won't be directly in contact with them while you're asleep by wearing clothes/pyjamas or by keeping a blanket between you and them. If you're like me and get gross and sweaty when you sleep, take a shower when you get up before cuddling with them.</p>
					<h3>when plasticizer leaches out</h3>
					<p>If you notice that your inflatable develops a strange oily spot while deflated, <u>do not wipe it off</u> - this is plasticizer beginning to leach out. It's natural for this to happen in small amounts when they're deflated for a long time, so just fully inflate them and leave them sit for a day, and the plasticizer will eventually soak back in. If you notice this happening in very large amounts, it's probably because of skin oils. Leave them sit for a day so they they can reabsorb as much plasticizer as possible, then give them a shower to wash off any remaining oils (see below).</p>
					<h3>i accidentally got oil on my inflatable - now what?</h3>
					<p>Fortunately, <u>if you catch it quickly enough</u>, you can give them a shower to wash off any oils before they cause harm (see below).</p>
					<h3>restoring lost plasticizer</h3>
					<p>It's possible to restore inflatables who have lost plasticizer, but I've never tried it personally. Apparently, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sculpey-Liquid-Softener-Fluid-Ounce/dp/B0047V7A56">Sculpey Clay Softener</a> can be applied to the inside of an inflatable through the valve to restore their softness. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfdpUMd-01E">This video</a> shows some more detail.</p>

					<h2>washing pool toys</h2>
					<p>If you get oil, dirt, dust, or any other gross stuff on your pool toy friend, giving them a shower is easy and fun. If you have access to a yard with a garden hose, that's the easiest way to do it, otherwise, you'll just have to cram them into your bathtub or shower.</p>
					<p>Once you wet them, lather them up with very diluted dish soap - I recommend using Dawn Free and Clear because it's the most gentle. Once they're washed, make sure to <i>completely</i> rinse off all the soap. If soap stays dried on an inflatable, it can cause the plasticizer to break down.</p>
					<p>For dust or dirt, you might be able to remove it with just a wet cloth or paper towel. This isn't enough to get oil off though - you'll need to actually give them a shower and use soap.</p>
					<p>Warning: <u>Don't use rubbing alcohol to clean your inflatable!</u> It can remove paint and markings and cause the plastic to harden.</p>

					<h1>patching and repairing</h1>
					<p><i>This page is still a work-in-progress and will eventually include photos and more information.</i></p>
					<p>Holes and leaks are just a part of life - every inflatable will get them at some point, so it's best to be prepared before it happens. Fortunately, they're usually quite easy to fix.</p>
					<hr>
					
					<h2>supplies</h2>
					<p>To repair leaks, you'll need flexible fabric glue and some vinyl to make patches out of.</p>
					<p><b>Glue:</b> I highly recommend <a href="https://www.loctiteproducts.com/en/products/specialty-products/specialty/loctite_vinyl_fabricplasticflexibleadhesive.html">Loctite Vinyl, Fabric, and Plastic</a> glue - it's what I always use and it works perfectly for pool toys, plus it's pretty cheap. <u>Don't use super glue!</u> It'll just harm your inflatable further and will require a more involved repair to fix.</p>
					<p><b>Vinyl:</b> I always just buy cheap beach balls and cut them up for patches and spare vinyl. They're usually very colorful, so you should be able to find a color that matches the spot on your inflatable that needs repaired.</p>
					
					<h2>finding the leak</h2>
					<p>The hardest part of repairing leaks is finding them. I usually tightly inflate the pool toy in a quiet room, then lay on them. The extra pressure will force more air out of the leak, and you should be able to hear a small, high-pitched sound coming from it. If you can't hear the leak, slowly run your finger along all of the inflatable's seams, and you'll eventually be able to feel where the leak is.</p>
					<p>If that doesn't work, mix up dish soap and water, then rub the soapy water over the inflatable's seams. The air coming out of the leak will cause bubbles to appear in the soapy water.</p>
					
					<h2>performing the repair</h2>
					<p>• First, make sure the inflatable is fully deflated.<br>
					• To create the patch, cut out a piece of vinyl that is at least 1/4" bigger than the leak on all sides. Round the corners of the patch so that they won't peel up after being applied.<br>
					• Next, put a generous amount of fabric glue on one side of the patch. Spread it around with your finger and make sure to cover it evenly and completely, especially the around the edges and corners.<br>
					• Flatten out the area of the inflatable where the leak is, then apply the patch so that it's centered on the leak. Smooth it out to get rid of any air bubbles underneath of it, then apply constant pressure to it for at least a minute so that it sticks in place. If the patch starts to curl or lift up while the glue is drying, apply more glue underneath of it and apply pressure for another minute or so.<br>
					• Leave them deflated for 24 hours to allow for the glue to cure, then they can be reinflated.</p>
