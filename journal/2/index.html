<p>i've been feeling kinda sick today, so i stayed home from work and spent my free time hanging out with sage. him and i tried sleeping in bed together for the first time last night, and it was wonderful! words can't describe now nice it is to fall asleep with a big, strong, loving dragon laying on top of you.</p>

<p class="caption">what a big boy! he takes up my entire bed.</p>

<p>ember's been wanting to play all day too, and it's so hard to resist those big beautiful eyes, but i'm just too wiped out from this lame cold to wrestle with him right now. i'll have to let him sleep with me tonight to make up for it (as long as sage doesn't steal the bed first!).</p>
