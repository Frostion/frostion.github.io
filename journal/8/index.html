<p>man, it's been a long time since i've made an art piece that i'm actually somewhat proud of. my last 'good' one, <a href="/art/thevoidwillanswer.png">"the void will answer"</a>, was all the way back in february. just as i thought i was losing my touch, inspiration finally struck once again!</p>

<p>this piece, "connected soul", was originally just an experiment with areo-style elements (those glass orbs!), but i fell in love with the style quicker than expected and turned it into a full-fledged project. it expresses the magical, powerful, limitless possibilites of multimedia-enabled personal computers. anything is possible once your soul is synchronized to the universe inside your computer.</p>
