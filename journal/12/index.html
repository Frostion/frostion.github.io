<p>i just got back from my first time attending <a href="https://vcfed.org/events/vintage-computer-festival-east/">Vintage Computer Festival (VCF) East</a>, a convention that's focused on tinkering with, showing off, buying, selling, and experiencing vintage computers of all kinds. here, there's no such thing as a computer being "old", "slow", or "obsolete". all computers throughout history are appreciated for their cool, unique, groundbreaking, and quirky features. the weirder and rarer, the better!</p>

<p>VCF takes place at <a href="https://www.infoage.org/">InfoAge</a>, a unique campus that was originally a US Navy radio communications laboratory during World War I and II. today, InfoAge is home to a wide variety of technology-focused museums and communities, including the Vintage Computer Federation, which runs both the VCF festival and the InfoAge vintage computer museum.</p>

<p>VCF features tons of events, talks, and classes to attend over the weekend, so i didn't have near enough time to do it all! if you'd like a more detailed recollection of this year's VCF, i'd recommend reading through voidstar's <a href="https://voidstar.blog/vcf-east-2023/">6-part blog entry</a> about their experiences at the convention.</p>

<h3>cool exhibits!</h3>

<p>the coolest part of attending VCF is seeing and interacting with all of the exhibits of rare, interesting, and unique hardware brought in by other attendees. i've always been particularly interested in Silicon Graphics computers, but never got the chance to see one in real life, let alone try one out. at this VCF, there were probably over a dozen SGI machines just hanging out in the exhibit room for anyone to mess around with, so i finally got a chance to experience IRIX and the pinnacle of early-90s 3D graphics for the first time in my life!</p>

<p>i totally forgot to take photos of most of the exhibits i saw, but here's a gallery of the few photos i did take:</p>

<p class="caption">this exhibit by Dan FitzGerald featured some classic MIDI action! a Macintosh named Macdonna was running Cubase and controlling a Roland MT-32 and Yamaha FB-01 over MIDI. attendees were invited to compose and play their own songs using this setup.</p>

<p class="caption">some unusual, non-Apple PowerPC computers designed by IBM and Motorola were on display here courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ncommander">NCommander</a>. this Motorola PowerStack is one of the coolest computer case designs i've seen!</p>

<p class="caption">the <a href="https://www.core64.io/">Core64</a> core memory kit on display, which allows you to build and weave your own arduino-compatible, 8-byte core memory module. krhainos bought one, so i'll be interested to see what the process is like! the model shown here even features neon bulbs behind each core that show the values currently stored on the cores!</p>

<img class="center" src="1_MVC-007F.JPG">
<p class="caption">turns out the developer of the Core64 kit is also a mavica fan! he even has one of those wild Memory Stick to floppy disk adapters for it.</p>

<p class="caption">remember Living Books? this beatiful exhibit pays homage to the Living Books series of multimedia CD-ROM edutainment software that presented kids with animated, voice-acted, interactive versions of classic storybooks. i distinctly remember playing <i>D.W. the Picky Eater</i> when i was in kindergarten, and krhainos got to relive the classic <i>Just Grandma and Me</i> at this exhibit.</p>

<p class="caption">this was my personal favorite exhibit at the convention. Genericable presented multiple different types of classic cable TV hardware, including the various Weather STAR machines that generated the Weather Channel's graphics, two different types of cable TV scramblers, and the Amigas that powered the Prevue/TV Guide channel.</p>

<h3>buying and selling at consignment</h3>

<p>another very cool part of attending VCF is consignment, the marketplace for buying and selling all sorts of vintage computing stuff. buying and selling at this event is super convenient as the staff handle all of the transactions for you - if you're selling something, all you have to do is just send them a spreadsheet of your items and their prices beforehand, then at the event, they'll give you barcode labels to stick on them. when you go to buy an item, you just bring it up to the checkout counter, a staff member scans the barcode, and you pay for it right there. after the event is over, VCF sends the sellers the money they earned via paypal or cash.</p>

<p>i've had a massive pile of various 8-bit computers taking up way too much space in my apartment (and my parents' basement) for years, so i finally decided to sell almost all of it off. i kept my commodore 128D and laser 128, but none of the other 8-bit machines really held my interest anymore, so i decided to sell them to others at VCF who would be able to give them the attention they deserve. i watched my items sell <i>way</i> more quickly than i had expected (they were gone before noon!), so before i was even able to make it to consignment myself, i knew i would have money to spare for whatever weird stuff i came across that i would want to buy.</p>

<h3>ok so what did i actually buy then???</h3>

<p>in the few weeks leading up to VCF, i started to develop a hyperfixation on PowerPC Macs, so i knew i had to buy at least one while i was there. while i was setting up my items in the consignment room the day before it would open, i saw some other people bringing in Power Mac G4s and iMac G5s to sell, so i made it my mission to buy a Quicksilver G4, a matching Studio Display, and an iMac G5 once consignment opened the following day.</p>

<p>krhainos and i arrived at 8am on saturday, an hour before consignment would even open, and the line to get in was already <i>insane</i> - it was out the door of the building. we decided to go check out some exhibits and wait for the line to die down, but by 10am or so, the line just got <i>longer</i>, so we decided to cut our losses and just wait in line. it moved quickly enough, but as i watched people walk out with Quicksilver G4s, Studio Displays, and iMacs, i became increasingly worried that i wouldn't be able to get any of the computers that i desired so much. fortunately, when we finally made it in, there was still a Quicksilver, a Studio Display, and an iMac G5 remaining, so i yoinked them up as quickly as possible. success!!!</p>

<p class="caption">the consignment area later in the day on saturday.</p>

<p>after that ordeal, we revisited consignment a couple more times later that day (and on sunday) once the business died down, so i was able to pick up a few other cool things i found there. in total, i ended up with all of this:</p>

<img class="center" src="imac.jpg">
<p class="caption">iMac G5, plus a copy of iLife '08<br>
the previous owner had upgraded this computer to 2GB of RAM - very cool!<br>
the previous owner did not wipe the drive and it was full of furry porn - not cool...</p>

<img class="center" src="powermac.jpg">
<p class="caption">Power Mac G4 (Quicksilver), plus a matching 17" Studio Display!<br>
the previous owner had wiped the drive and installed a fresh copy of osx on it. thank god</p>

<p>some other items i picked up include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a Nokia N810 Internet Tablet - did you know that the official maemo community repository is still functional and being updated??? i was shocked when i opened up the 'app store' on it and it actually worked. this device warrants future exploration for sure!</li>
	<li>and the Internet Membership Kit (Macintosh Version) - ok i bought this box o' software just because i loved the name of it, but it ended up being way more interesting than i thought it would be. this kit contains the <i>Internet Yellow Pages</i>, a guidebook full of cool stuff to do on the early 90s internet, before HTTP was a thing at all! it's a directory of gopher holes, anonymous FTP servers, telnet sites, and usenet groups, all sorted by topic of interest. i'll have to explore this in more detail later, as the early, pre-www internet is something i find deeply fascinating. i should probably also give the included software a try sometime.
</ul>

<p>so yeah, VCF was sick as heck!!!! i'll totally be going again in the future and you should too. there's another VCF happening in september (VCF midwest) that i'll also try to attend.</p>
