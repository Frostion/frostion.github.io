<h2>2022.07.18 - new website style!</h2>

<p>because i can't leave anything alone, i <i>completely</i> redesigned my website yet again! i've always loved pixel-perfect bitmap interfaces - especially glossy ones - so of course i had to make my website into one of those. i took a lot of inspiration from the winamp skin i use, <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/soulseek3r/art/DepthVision-v2-Winamp-Skin-18203810">depthvision</a>. (my site doesn't look near as good as that does, though)</p>
