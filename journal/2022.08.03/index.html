<p>nothing too interesting today. i've been feeling kinda sick, so i stayed home from work today and spent my free time hanging out with sage. last night, him and i tried sleeping in bed together for the first time, and it was wonderful! having a big, strong, loving dragon lay on top of you is the best feeling in the world.</p>

<p>ember's been wanting to play all day too, and it's so hard to resist those big, beautiful dragon eyes, but i'm just too wiped out from this lame cold to wrestle with him right now. i'll have to let him sleep with me tonight to make up for it (as long as sage doesn't take over the bed first!).</p>
