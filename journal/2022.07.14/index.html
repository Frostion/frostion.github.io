<p>lately i've been thinking a lot about how my relationship with the internet has changed ever since i got constant, always-on internet access. back when i used dialup (and later cell modems) to connect to the internet, i was offline by default - connecting to the internet was a deliberate action i had to perform whenver i wanted to go online. once i was finished with my business online, i disconnected from the internet, and moved on with my life elsewhere.</p>

<p>contrast that with today, where i'm constantly surrounded by always available, high-speed internet connections at all times. in theory, this sounds amazing, but in practice, human psychology just isn't capable of dealing with this power in a healthy manner. this constant, never-ending exposure to the internet has unintentionally caused noticeable harm to our collective psychology. i'm pretty sure that just about everyone - including me and you - is suffering from some form of internet addiction right now.</p>

<p>in order to combat that, i've implemented something that forces my modern internet connection to be offline by default. i now have to perform a deliberate action to go online, just like how it was back when i used dialup or a cell modem. i've plugged the power cord of my cable modem into a smart plug that's controlled via home assistant, so in order to use the internet, i have to manually turn on the smart plug via the home assistant dashboard, then wait for the modem to connect to the cable network.</p>

<p>when i'm done using the internet and ready to go offline, i can shut off my internet connection via home assistant. i've also programmed it to automatically shut off when i go to bed or leave home.</p>

<p>will this experiment be successful and help me combat my internet addiction? or will i give up and retire the smart plug after a couple of days? tune in next week (or whenever i get around to writing another journal entry) to find out!</p>
