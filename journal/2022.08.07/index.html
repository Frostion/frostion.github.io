<p>today a good friend of mine surprised me out of the blue and gave me a gateway performance 1500 - my childhood computer! the original computer i had as a kid is sadly long gone, so this is as close as i can get to having it back. it's in great cosmetic condition and boots up fine, but the hard drive and fans will need to be replaced soon (they're 20+ years old, so that's to be expected). i couldn't be happier right now - it feels like i've been reunited with an old friend. i'm so excited to get this guy up and running and relive my childhood computing memories!</p>

<p>next time i visit my parents, i'll have to see if they still have any of the old software CDs that came with that gateway.</p>

<p>in other news, the vaio's hard drive was starting to act a little strange, so i got a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002SZDOM6">SATA-to-IDE adapter</a> off of amazon and cloned its drive onto a fresh new SSD. the performance boost is insane - it can actually handle having multiple firefox tabs open at once now! it's definitely a much happier computer.</p>
