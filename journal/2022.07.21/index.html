<p>unfortunately my <a href="?entry=2022.07.14">deliberate internet access project</a> from earlier ended in failure - not because i gave up on it, but because my modem did not like being powered through a smart plug. the smart plug is literally just a relay so i don't understand how it could affect anything, but several times since deploying it, the modem would randomly lose connection to the cable network and be unable to reconnect. removing the smart plug and plugging the modem directly into an outlet instead fixed the issue immediately, every time.</p>

<p>this project will just have to be suspended until i can get a better router that allows me to control internet access via an API of some sort. (at the moment i have a google wifi router, which is completely locked down and can't be controlled by anything but the abysmal google home app. i definitely learned my lesson about buying google hardware.)</p>
