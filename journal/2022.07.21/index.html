					<h2>2022.07.21 - deliberate internet access no longer</h2>

					<p>unfortunately my <a href="../2022.07.14/">deliberate internet access project</a> ended in failure - not because i lost the willpower to continue it, but because my modem did not like being plugged in through a smart plug for some reason. the smart plug is literally just a relay so i don't understand how it could affect anything, but several times since starting this project, the modem would randomly lose connection to the cable network and not be able to reconnect, even after being power cycled. removing the smart plug and plugging the modem directly into an outlet instead fixed the issue immediately, every time.</p>
					<p>this project will just have to be suspended until i can get a better router that allows me to control internet access via an API of some sort. (at the moment i have a google wifi router, which is the most locked-down piece of junk ever. i definitely learned my lesson about buying google hardware.)</p>
