<p>i've finally customized my phone's launcher in a way that i'm happy with! i have a <a href="https://www.unihertz.com/products/titan-pocket">unihertz titan pocket</a>, a fantastic phone that i really should write a review about sometime. even though it's a smartphone, i just use it like a feature phone with the added ability to connect to IM services (like discord and telegram), so today i decided to flex my customization muscles and create a home screen for it that gives off that feature phone vibe.</p>

<p>to achieve this, i used <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ginlemon.flowerfree&hl=en_US&gl=US">smart launcher</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.hungrydeveloper.simpletextwidget&hl=en_US&gl=US">simple text widget</a> for the folder labels, and the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.benx9.cactus&hl=en_US&gl=US">rondo icon pack</a> for a unified look.</p>
