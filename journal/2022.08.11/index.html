<p>i've finally customized my phone's launcher in a way that i'm happy with! i have a <a href="https://www.unihertz.com/products/titan-pocket">unihertz titan pocket</a>, a fantastic phone that i really should write a review about sometime. even though it's a smartphone, i mostly just use it as a feature phone with IM functionality, so today i decided to create a custom home screen for it that gives off that 2010s feature phone vibe. i think it turned out pretty well!</p>

<p>to achieve this, i used <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ginlemon.flowerfree&hl=en_US&gl=US">smart launcher</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.hungrydeveloper.simpletextwidget&hl=en_US&gl=US">simple text widget</a> for the folder labels, and the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.benx9.cactus&hl=en_US&gl=US">rondo icon pack</a> for a unified look.</p>
