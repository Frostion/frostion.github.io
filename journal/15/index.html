<p>every weather app and website sucks. they either have a pretty UI but provide hopelessly inaccurate forecasts (such as apple weather), or they provide decently accurate data but with such a dysfunctional UI that you'd never be able to actually read it anyways (looking at you, wunderground). if you're in the US, then the most accurate source of weather forecasts is the National Weather Service, but their website is pretty clunky to browse, especially on mobile. general daily forcasts, more specific data, and hourly graphs are all spread out between separate pages, requiring you to bounce all over their site just to get a good idea of the upcoming forecast.</p>
<p>having been annoyed by this issue for several years now, i finally decided to take matters into my own hands and make a weather website that doesn't actually suck. i present to you - <a href="https://www.cyberdragon.digital/apps/weather/">Cyberdragon Weather!</a> (working title)</p>
<p>this page fetches your current location, then uses the <a href="https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api">NWS API</a> to show you the daily and hourly weather forecast for the next 7 days (plus any active alerts) with a fast and easy to read interface - no ads, no clickbait, no tracking, and no accounts. plus, it works great on mobile too.</p>
<p>NOTE: because this site sources its data from the NWS, it will only work for locations within the US.</p>
