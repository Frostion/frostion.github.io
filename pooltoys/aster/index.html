				<h2>Species</h2>
				<p>Hongyi Lucario</p>
				
				<h2>About</h2>
				<p></p>
				<p>I got Aster from a friend for super cheap a couple of years ago. Of course I instantly fell in love with him, and he became my boyfriend for a few months.</p>
				<p>However...the paint that Hongyi uses on their toys comes off <i>extremely</i> easily, especially if it gets wet (yep, pool toys that get damaged if they touch water). I didn't know this at the time, so I gave him regular showers like all of my other toys to prevent plasticizer loss caused by skin oils. This of course caused massive areas of paint to flake and rub off, completely ruining his once beautiful appearance.</p>
				<p>Because I couldn't bathe him at all, he unfortunately developed plasticizer loss on various parts of his body over time. It's also worth mentioning that the paint Hongyi uses is so rough that some parts of him feel just like sandpaper.</p>
				<p>My recommendation: just don't buy inflatables made by Hongyi - I know I won't any more. Not only do they steal character designs, but their products are terrible and definitely <u>not</u> worth the outrageous prices they charge.</p>
				
				<h2>Physical Properties</h2>
				<p><img class="score" src="../scores/2.png"></img>&emsp;<b>Overall</b><br>
				He's really cute and cuddly, but I can't recommend these toys because of the construction and paint issues.</p>
				<p><img class="score" src="../scores/3.png"></img>&emsp;<b>Material</b><br>
				Decently soft, average pool toy material.</p>
				<p><img class="score" src="../scores/4.png"></img>&emsp;<b>Appearance</b><br>
				He's definitely cute! The printing quality isn't amazing, but it's not bad either.</p>
				<p><img class="score" src="../scores/3.png"></img>&emsp;<b>Construction</b><br>
				All of the seams are strong and folded over and there were no factory defects, but the craftsmanship was visibly messier than on most other toys.</p>
				<p><img class="score" src="../scores/1.png"></img>&emsp;<b>Durability</b><br>
				The vinyl itself is pretty durable, but the fact the paint just flakes off when it gets wet (and even from light friction) is inexcusable. $10 pool toys from Walmart have better paint.</p>
				<p><img class="score" src="../scores/4.png"></img>&emsp;<b>Cuddleability</b><br>
				His size and shape are perfect for cuddling with in bed! I had to deduct a point though because the horrible paint used on him feels like sandpaper in some spots.</p>
