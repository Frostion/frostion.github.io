				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>This chonker is so hecking adorable! He's big and soft enough to lay down on and cuddle with, or even fall asleep on. He's great to hang out with!</p>
				<p>The material he's made out of isn't <i>quite</i> as soft and stretchy as more expensive toys, but it's not noticeable at all when snuggling with him. The overall build quality, durability, and artwork/printing are all top-notch. They could double the price on this toy and he would still be worth it.</p>
				<p>You should totally adopt one of these guys - as long as you have the space! These Laprases (Laprii? idk) are definitely big (but that's not a bad thing at all).</p>
				
				<h2>Physical Properties</h2>
				<p><img class="score" src="../scores/5.png"></img>&emsp;<b>Overall</b><br>
				One of my favorites for sure. He's big, extremely cute, and loves to cuddle.</p>
				<p><img class="score" src="../scores/4.png"></img>&emsp;<b>Material</b><br>
				Above average in softness and smoothness, but not <i>quite</i> as squishy as some toys.</p>
				<p><img class="score" src="../scores/5.png"></img>&emsp;<b>Appearance</b><br>
				One of the cutest inflatables I've seen, and the printing quality is great.</p>
				<p><img class="score" src="../scores/5.png"></img>&emsp;<b>Construction</b><br>
				His seams and overall craftsmanship are perfect.</p>
				<p><img class="score" src="../scores/4.png"></img>&emsp;<b>Durability</b><br>
				He's held up well to me laying on and snuggling with him, but his baffle seam is a little fragile, especially when tightly inflated.</p>
				<p><img class="score" src="../scores/5.png"></img>&emsp;<b>Cuddleability</b><br>
				His huge size and soft material make him a great bed.</p>
