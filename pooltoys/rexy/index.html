				<h2>Species</h2>
				<p><a href="https://www.inflatableworld-wsp.de/catalog/product_info.php/fox-white-matte-p-109">Inflatable World White Fox (matte)</a></p>
				
				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>There's just something about Rexy's design that I really like - he just looks <i>majestic</i>. He's also quite soft and nice to hug!</p>
				<p>Sadly, I can't recommend adopting one of these foxes if you're primarily looking for a cuddle buddy, because he's just too big and awkward. He's still fun to have around though!</p>
				
				<h2>Physical Properties</h2>
				<p><img class="score" src="../scores/3.png"></img>&emsp;<b>Overall</b><br>
				I love his design, but sadly he's just not really cuddleable.</p>
				<p><img class="score" src="../scores/5.png"></img>&emsp;<b>Material</b><br>
				Exceptionally soft and smooth, as usual for Inflatable World.</p>
				<p><img class="score" src="../scores/5.png"></img>&emsp;<b>Appearance</b><br>
				As I mentioned before, I really love his beautiful, majestic design.</p>
				<p><img class="score" src="../scores/5.png"></img>&emsp;<b>Construction</b><br>
				His seams and overall craftsmanship are perfect.</p>
				<p><img class="score" src="../scores/5.png"></img>&emsp;<b>Durability</b><br>
				I haven't done enough with him to properly rate his durability, but it seems totally fine.</p>
				<p><img class="score" src="../scores/1.png"></img>&emsp;<b>Cuddleability</b><br>
				Sadly, because of his shape and massive size, he's just not cuddleable. He's great for hugs though at least!</p>
