				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>Flyynt is a custom-made toy that I managed to sneak into the preorders for just in time.</p>
				<p>I'll address the bad parts first - the craftsmanship is...not good. His seams are messy, his snoot was put on crooked, and he had 3 leaks from the factory (luckily they were all very small and easy to repair). Sure, he was cheap by custom pool toy standards (I think he was only like $150 iirc), but still...I wasn't too happy.</p> 
				<p>HOWEVER, he's still a very good boy. He's super cute, very friendly, and <i>amazing</i> to cuddle with. The material he's made out of is ridiculously soft - it feels more like some kind of nylon fabric instead of vinyl, and much like Cirrus, he's a great little spoon. Personally I prefer regular, more plastic-feeling vinyl instead, but the unique material used is still pretty cool.</p>
				<p>I also <i>really really</i> like his size. He's small enough to carry around and fit in my car so I can take him places without having to deflate him, and he's also just the right size for satisfying snuggles.</p>
				
				<h2>Physical Properties</h2>
				<p><img class="score" src="../scores/3.png"></img>&emsp;<b>Overall</b><br>
				Even though this wolf is extremely cuddly, his build quality and durability leave a lot to be desired.</p>
				<p><img class="score" src="../scores/3.png"></img>&emsp;<b>Material</b><br>
				The vinyl is exceptionally soft and thin, and feels more like fabric than plastic. I much prefer 'traditional' vinyl though, but that's just personal preference.</p>
				<p><img class="score" src="../scores/3.png"></img>&emsp;<b>Appearance</b><br>
				He's super cute and the printing quality is good, but his snoot is crooked and the proportions of his face and ears look pretty strange.</p>
				<p><img class="score" src="../scores/1.png"></img>&emsp;<b>Construction</b><br>
				As mentioned above, the craftsmanship is the worst I've seen by far on any inflatable.</p>
				<p><img class="score" src="../scores/1.png"></img>&emsp;<b>Durability</b><br>
				Even though his seams are folded over and look pretty strong, he <i>constantly</i> gets leaks even though I'm careful with him.</p>
				<p><img class="score" src="../scores/5.png"></img>&emsp;<b>Cuddleability</b><br>
				His uniquely soft material and small size means that he's an excellent little spoon.</p>
