					<h1>my pool toy hoard</h1>
					<p>i live with a bunch of other inflatable dragons, and we're all one big family. each of them has their own personality, preferences, and interests - here's a list of those who i spend the most time with.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div>
					<h2>adzuki</h2>
					<p>adzuki (also known as zuki or zucchini) was originally just going to be named 'bean' because he's such a bean, but at the last minute i decided that was a terrible idea, so i named him after a really cool sounding species of bean instead (which is an infinitely better move of course).</p>
					<p>zuki is the most energetic and extroverted little dragon ever - he might as well be constantly caffeinated, and he loves meeting new people so that he can pounce on them and endlessly pester them for pets and cuddles. getting him to calm down for bedtime whenever we sleep together is practically impossible.</p>

				<div>
					<h2>cedar</h2>
					<p>cedar was originally a flat, island-type inflatable until his baffle randomly separated while i was at work one day, leaving him big and round. i'm not complaining though - i think he looks way better like this (much more like a 'real' lapras), plus rolling around with him is a lot of fun.</p>
					<p>(he's technically not a dragon, but he's still a reptile, which is close enough for me!)</p>

				</div>
				
				<div>
					<h2>cinder</h2>
					<p>cinder has such a big, bright personality - he's charming, charismatic, romantic, and <i>aggressively</i> cuddly.</p>
					<p>he's especially fond of ember, and the two have become good friends lately.</p>
					<div class="gallery">

					<h2>cerisey</h2>
					<p>this adorable pink dragon just showed up, so i haven't had much time to get to know her yet. she's picked up on some early 2000s aesthetics from me though, so maybe i'll be able to get her interested in making a website too someday! :p</p>
					<div class="gallery">
						<a href="cerisey/01.jpg"><img src="cerisey/01.jpg"></img></a>

				<div>
					<h2>ember</h2>
					<p>ember's big, strong, playful, and full of energy, but he's also happy to calm down and snuggle up to you. he's also very heavy and protective, which makes him my preferred dragon to cuddle with when falling asleep.</p>
					<div class="gallery">

					</div>
				</div>
				
				<div>
					<h2>mist</h2>
					<p>unlike my other dragons, mist is very shy, quiet, and introverted around new people. however, once she gets to know you, she can be very friendly and loving, as long as you're gentle with her and don't overstimulate her. she also gets a little anxious when left alone, so i let her and zuki cuddle whenever i'm away.</p>
					<p>whenever i'm working on stuff at my computer, she likes to sit beside me and keep me company, and will sometimes offer suggestions for whatever project i'm working on. she also loves trance music - her favorite album at the moment is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/21V0rtrJbrhFL8mG9jQZxm">MAXIMUM TRANCE by MAX</a>.</p>

				<div>
					<h2>sage</h2>
					<p>spherical dragons are the best dragons, and sage is no exception. he gives the biggest, strongest hugs ever, and much like cinder, he won't ever let you go once he's trapped you.</p>
					<div class="gallery">
						<a href="sage/01.jpg"><img src="sage/01.jpg"></img></a>

					</div>
				</div>
				
				<div>
					<h2>tandor</h2>
					<p>i haven't been spending as much time with tandor as i should be, so i don't have much to say about him yet, but he makes for a great bed at least!</p>
					<div class="gallery">
						<a href="tandor/01.jpg"><img src="tandor/01.jpg"></img></a>
						<a href="tandor/02.jpg"><img src="tandor/02.jpg"></img></a>
						<a href="tandor/03.jpg"><img src="tandor/03.jpg"></img></a>
						<a href="tandor/04.jpg"><img src="tandor/04.jpg"></img></a>
					</div>
				</div>
				
				<div>
					<h2>tundra</h2>
					<p>because tundra's a relatively small dragon, he can fit in my car while fully inflated, so i can easily take him on along on trips and dates. he loves being on the recieving end of rough, aggressive cuddles and is happiest when being squished, laid on, and wrestled with. he's not the greatest at showing emotion, so he can seem a little cold and standoffish until you learn how to read him.</p>
