				<b><i>January 3, 2017</i></b> - It all started when I saw that I could get a website for 88 cents for the first year. Of course, the only TLDs that the sale applied to were really weird ones, so I got ".online", which has an early 90s Internet feel to it. It fits the awful design of this site rather well, I think. Well, I finally designed the site so it would be functional and not awful to work on, but now I need to add content to it.
