			<h2 id="criteria">Pokémon Plushie Review Criteria</h2>
			<p class="header"><b>I'll be rating all of the plushies I own using the following criteria on a scale from 1 to 10:</b><br>
			<b>Cuddly:</b> The most important criteria. How nice and comfortable it is to hold and hug the plushie.<br>
			<b>Interesting:</b> How unique the design of the plushie/source material is. Usually correlates with how many details there are. A boring design doesn't necessarily mean it's bad, but it helps when it's interesting.<br>
			<b>Details:</b> How nice and neat the embroidery and details are.<br>
			<b>Construction:</b> How solid, durable, and well-made it feels. (I personally don't like overly soft/squishy/floppy plushies.)<br>
			<b>Overall:</b> This is not an average, just my opinion of the plushie in general.</p>

			<h2 id="training">Tomy Training Plushies</h2>
			<p class="header">These plushies from Tomy are very large (about 16in tall), make sounds, and are made to stand up to just about anything. These are by far the best official Pokémon plushies in my opinion. Too bad there's only two in the series - I would love to see more plushies like these in the future.</p>

			<ul>
				<li><p><b>Image select: </b><a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="document.getElementById('lucario_img').src='images/lucario/front.jpg'">Front</a> | <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="document.getElementById('lucario_img').src='images/lucario/side.jpg'">Side</a> | <a href="javascript:void(0)" onclick="document.getElementById('lucario_img').src='images/lucario/back.jpg'">Back</a> | <a target="_blank" href="images/lucario/hires.jpg">Hi-res wallpaper (new tab)</a></p></li>
				<li><p><b>Cuddly: 10/10</b> - He's 15" tall, which makes him a great size to hug. His arms and legs are just squishy enough that they are surprisingly flexible, so he can move and conform to your hug.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Interesting: 10/10</b> - Lucario has always been a super rad Pokémon design. A ruthless warrior jackal that can read and modify the thoughts and emotions of anyone within a half-mile radius? Awesome.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Details: 10/10</b> - All of his markings, little spikes, and weird fur fluff thing on his back all look great. He even has pads on his paws! His head and face are especially nice and detailed - especially his lil snout.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Construction: 10/10</b> - Firm, solid, yet flexible enough to move and hug - which I absolutely love. (None of the smaller plushies are flexible at all, so this is just another way that Lucario is better.) The stitching isn't coming loose anytime soon, that's for sure. Lucario is made impressively well - it's surprisng he was only $25. He would still be worth it if the price was doubled.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Overall: AMAZING/10</b> - I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say this Lucario is probably the best thing in existence. The only thing better would a be life-size one - I'll probably end up getting one made sometime.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Sounds: </b>Lucario makes sounds when hit - he makes a variety of growls and yells. Other reviewers on the Internet have mentioned that they find the sounds hard to trigger, but they usually try to press his chest. You actually have to hit him to get him to make sounds (which isn't very kind). The sounds are designed well - they aren't too loud or go on for too long, which are problems other sound-making things usually have. I usually keep this feature turned off, especially at night, as it's pretty sensitive to movement and I don't want him to yell at me and wake me up if I move around when sleeping. It's a pretty fun addition though that makes him seem more "alive".</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Would I recommend this? </b>YES! I would recommend this amazing plushie to everyone! You would have to be some angry, awful, soulless person to not instantly fall in love with Lucario.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>A few weeks later: </b>At the time that I'm writing this, I've had Lucario for a month and a half, and he's still just as amazing as when I first got him (I think he somehow got even <i>more</i> cuddly). No complaints at all.</p></li>

				<li><p><b>Cuddly: 9/10</b> - I had originally given him an 8 on this scale but decided to <i>INCREASE</i> the rating after spending more time with him. He's really big (even bigger than Lucario!), which automatically gives him a high score on the cuddly scale. He's also soft and firm in the right places - his head and chest are very firm, but his limbs are soft enough to be very flexible, so he's much nicer to hug. My only complaint is the big flame details on his arms - they kinda poke you in the face when you hug him.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Interesting: 9/10</b> - Blaziken's design is about as unique as Lucario's. I would've never thought that a humanoid chicken man would be this cuddly and nice-looking.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Details: 10/10</b> - While some of the details like the flames on his arms are bent on my Blaziken, it's nothing wrong with the plushie, it just wasn't packaged very well so all of the little details were squished against the box. Other than that little point, this plushie looks just like Mega Blaziken. No complaints at all.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Construction: 10/10</b> - Just like Lucario, Blaziken is impressively durable, surprisingly flexible, and definitely not coming apart anytime soon. And just like Lucario, he was only $25, which I still find unbelievable. I mentioned earlier that his chest is weirdly firm, but everything else is the perfect balance of squish and firm.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Overall: 9/10</b> - He's not quite as cuddly as Lucario (but it's pretty much impossible to be cuddlier than Lucario), but he's still an amazing plushie, especially for the price.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Sounds: </b>Blaziken also makes sounds - yells and growls, smiliar to Lucario. (Go read his review for info on this.) Lucario and Blaziken do actually make different sounds: Lucario yells more, while Blaziken growls and grunts more.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Would I recommend this? </b>Also YES! While Blaziken isn't as heart-melting as Lucario, he's still one of the best plushies I've ever seen.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>A few weeks later: </b>At the time that I'm writing this, I've had Blaziken for about a month, and I like him a lot more now that I've spent some time with him. I only have one really minor complaint: his legs are a bit too soft, so they're kinda floppy. Other than that, he's been about as amazing as Lucario so far.</p></li>

			<h2 id="eevee">Eeveelution Plushies</h2>
			<p class="header">All of these Pokémon evolve from Eevee when certain criteria are met, like being exposed to special stones. They're all exceptionally cute, and make for good plushies. These are all also made by Tomy. I wish the plushies were bigger, though - they're usually 7-9in tall.</p>
			<img class="zoomable" src="images/eevee.jpg">
			<h3 id="eevee">Eevee <img class="icon" src="icons/cute.png"></h3>
			<ul>
				<li><p><b>Cuddly: 7/10</b> - This plushie is almost as cute and cuddly as the real thing (he's real in my heart). His fur is pretty soft, which always helps.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Interesting: 5/10</b> - To be honest, Eevee isn't the most interesting design, even if he is one of the cutest things around.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Details: 9/10</b> - As mentioned earlier, Eevee doesn't have a lot of interesting designs, but all the details that are present are very nice - the little bit of embroidery is neat and clean, and everything in general just looks good.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Construction: 10/10</b> - Same as most of the other plushies - solid, firm, and well made in general.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Overall: 7.5/10</b> - Basically everything you could want in an Eevee plush (except size).</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Would I recommend this? </b>Yes! Even people who aren't into Pokémon can still appreciate his cuteness.</p></li>

				<li><p><b>Cuddly: 9/10</b> - This Eevee is noticeably bigger than the regular-sized Eevee (see the "With Small Eevee" image), and is quite a bit cuddlier as well. He actually has fur everywhere (unlike the regular Eevee), and it's really, really soft (better than Flareon's)! The fur around his neck is just as fluffy as you would expect from a nice Eevee.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Interesting: 5/10</b> - As stated before, Eevee just isn't the most interesting Pokémon design around.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Details: 9/10</b> - As mentioned before, his fur is incredibly soft (which is why I gave him an extra half point on this rating). His ears are also more correctly sized than the smaller Eevee's (whose ears were a bit disproportionately small). There are a few little things wrong though: his head is too big, and (on this specific one) his mouth is slightly askew.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Construction: 10/10</b> - As always, Tomy plushies are made extremely well. Solid-feeling, no visible stitches, and really clean embroidery.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Overall: 9/10</b> - Overall, this is a better Eevee than the regular-sized one, mostly because of his super soft fur.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Would I recommend this? </b>Yes - even more than the regular Eevee plush! He's big, soft, and cute enough that anyone can enjoy him.</p></li>

			<h3 id="espeon">Espeon <img class="icon" src="icons/cute.png"></h3>
			<ul>
				<li><p><b>Cuddly: 6/10</b> - He has really soft fur, but is just a bit too small to be huggable.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Interesting: 7/10</b> - A bit more interesting than Eevee, mostly because of his colors and extra ear details.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Details: 10/10</b> - Just like Eevee, everything here is great. I gave Espeon an extra point over Eevee because Espeon's ears are actually stuffed, not just a few layers of fabric. Nice touch.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Construction: 10/10</b> - Same thing as usual: firm, solid, well-made in general.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Overall: 7.5/10</b> - Espeon isn't anything extremely special, but is still somewhat cuddly and pretty nice to look at.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Would I recommend this? </b>Yes, if you're a fan of the Eeveelutions.</p></li>
			</ul>

			<img class="zoomable" src="images/flareon.jpg">
			<h3 id="flareon">Flareon <img class="icon" src="icons/cute.png"></h3>
			<ul>
				<li><p><b>Cuddly: 7.5/10</b> - Flareon's fur is by far the softest of any of these plushies. He's a bit bigger than a few of the others, which automatically makes him more huggable.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Interesting: 7/10</b> - A spicy fire doggo, but with EXTRA FUR.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Details: 9/10</b> - Everything is great, but his yellow fur is especially amazing. The English language is lacking in words to use to describe how soft and smooth it is.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Construction: 10/10</b> - Same thing as usual: firm, solid, well-made in general.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Overall: 8.5/10</b> - Super cuddly and made really well. Good overall plushie.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Would I recommend this? </b> Yes! Much like Eevee, any plushie fan can appreciate his fluffiness.</p></li>

			<img class="zoomable" src="images/glaceon.jpg">
			<h3 id="glaceon">Glaceon</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><p><b>Cuddly: 6/10</b> - Surprisingly soft and huggable, but a bit too firm and small. I'm pretty picky when it comes to plushie firmness.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Interesting: 7/10</b> - I always found Glaceons pretty neat, probably because they're frosty.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Details: 3/10</b> - Oh man. There's a lot wrong here. His ears aren't just fabric, there's a plastic tab keeping them in place. Unfortunately, the plastic tabs on this one are very...not symmetrical, leading to one of the ears to point in a totally different direction than the other. The weird flappy things that hang below his ears are made out of some kind of material that if bent, will stay that way forever. See the picture for what I'm talking about. His eyes and face just look off - there's something not quite right there.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Construction: 5/10</b> - Still feels solid like the others, but is too firm for my liking. See the details section for more reasons why I'm not a big fan of the construction.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Overall: 4/10</b> - Poor Glaceon seems to be having some trouble with his ears...and a few other things. Not too impressed with this plush, to be honest. Looks pretty derpy.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Would I recommend this? </b> Unless you're just trying to collect all the Eeveelution plushies, I really can't recommend Glaceon.</p></li>

			<img class="zoomable" src="images/jolteon.jpg">
			<h3 id="jolteon">Jolteon</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><p><b>Cuddly: 7.5/10</b> - Jolteon is a bit bigger and softer than most of the other ones.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Interesting: 8/10</b> - There's a lot about Jolteon that is neat and unique design-wise, from his white pointy collar to his spiky fur and lack of a tail.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Details: 6/10</b> - The big problem here is his head. It's too big and wide for his body, which makes his eyes weirdly far apart. Other than that, his collar and spikes are pretty nice.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Construction: 9/10</b> - Same thing as usual: firm, solid, well-made in general. He seems a bit softer than the others, which is always nice.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Overall: 7/10</b> - Surprisingly cuddly, the only thing I don't really like about him is his disproportionate head.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Would I recommend this? </b>Yes, if you're an Eeveelution fan.</p></li>

			<h3 id="leafeon">Leafeon <img class="icon" src="icons/cute.png"></h3>
			<ul>
				<li><p><b>Cuddly: 4/10</b> - All of his pointy plant bits make it hard to hold and hug him comfortably.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Interesting: 10/10</b> - Leafeon has an interesting design with the perfect amount of neat little visual details and extras (not too crazy, like Arceus kinda is).</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Details: 9/10</b> - As said before, Leafeon has a lot of little details, and all of them are present in this plushie and look great. The little leaf bits that stick out are very thick, so they don't get bent easily.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Construction: 9/10</b> - Same thing as usual: firm, solid, well-made in general.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Overall: 7/10</b> - Definitely one of the nicest looking plushies I have, but he's just not that cuddly.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Would I recommend this? </b>Yes, if you're an Eeveelution fan, and you're ok with his un-cuddliness.</p></li>

			<img class="zoomable" src="images/sylveon.jpg">
			<h3 id="sylveon">Sylveon <img class="icon" src="icons/cute.png"></h3>
			<ul>
				<li><p><b>Cuddly: 6.5/10</b> - No pointy details stand in the way of giving him hugs, but there's nothing that makes him <i>extra</i> cuddly.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Interesting: 9/10</b> - Probably the most unique Eeveelution (but he's a bit too pastel for my liking, so I docked a point here).</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Details: 10/10</b> - All of the ribbons and bows look and feel fantastic.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Construction: 6/10</b> - My biggest problem with Sylveon is his neck. It's too loose, so if you try to pet him, his head just moves up, which leaves both of you with an unsatisfying petting experience. A little too squishy in some places, but still well made, like most of the others.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Overall: 7/10</b> - Pretty cuddly, really nice details, but he needs a stiffer neck.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Would I recommend this? </b>Yes, if you're an Eeveelution fan.</p></li>

			<hr>
			<img class="zoomable" src="images/umbreon.jpg">
			<h3 id="umbreon">Umbreon</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><p><b>Cuddly: 6/10</b> - He's one of the smaller plushies, so not that satisfying for cuddling.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Interesting: 8/10</b> - Umbreon is another unique and cool-looking design that isn't too crazy with little details.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Details: 7/10</b> - The yellow markings on him are all nice and where they should be, but his head is a little weird. A bit too wide or not deep enough or something, so his eyes end up too far apart. His fur is also dark grey instead of black, which looks kinda weird.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Construction: 9/10</b> - Same thing as usual: firm, solid, well-made in general.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Overall: 6/10</b> - Well made with nice markings, but not amazingly cuddly or interesting. The weird fur color annoys me a bit more than it should.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Would I recommend this? </b>Not really unless you're a big Umbreon fan or are trying to collect all the Eeveelution plushies.</p></li>

			<h3 id="vaporeon">Vaporeon <img class="icon" src="icons/cute.png"></h3>
			<ul>
				<li><p><b>Cuddly: 8/10</b> - One of the biggest Eeveelution plushies, so he's automatically really huggable. He is also the perfect firmness for me.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Interesting: 9/10</b> - I would've never thought that a dog, fish, and mermaid could be combined into something that looks nice, but it was accomplished really well, and he's still really cute.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Details: 9/10</b> - This Vaporeon looks pretty much perfect - like he came directly out of a Pokémon game.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Construction: 8/10</b> - The perfect firmness for my liking, and like most of the others, he's solid and made well in general. The only thing that I don't like is the fact that his tail is stuck to his leg.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Overall: 8.5/10</b> - My favorite Eeveelution has, in my opinion, one of the best Eeveelution plushies.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Would I recommend this? </b>Yes! Like Eevee, anyone can appreciate Vaporeon's cuteness.</p></li>

			<h3 id="tinyeevee">Tiny Keychain Eevee <img class="icon" src="icons/cute.png"></h3>
			<ul>
				<li><p><b>Cuddly: 1/10</b> - He's only about 4 inches tall, so as expected, this Eevee is impossible to cuddle with. It doesn't really matter though, as this Eevee is meant to clip on a backpack or something, not for cuddles :(</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Interesting: 5/10</b> - Just like the bigger Eevee, he's not a terribly interesting Pokémon.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Details: 7/10</b> - Everything on this Eevee looks pretty nice, which is impressive considering his small size. His neck fur is surprisingly soft and fluffy. His back legs are a bit weird, though - they're just little stumps.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Construction: 9/10</b> - Like all the other Tomy plushies, this Eevee is really well made, even though he's really small.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Overall: 9/10</b> - A nice lil Eevee for decorating.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Would I recommend this? </b>Yes, only if you have something to clip him to - he's not a general purpose Eevee.</p></li>

				<li><p><b>Made by: </b>Jakks Pacific - <b>Height: </b>16in  - <b>Length: </b>16in</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Cuddly: 10/10</b> - Words cannot fully describe how <b><i>EXTREMELY CUDDLY</i></b> Palkia is. He's massive (16in tall, 16in long) which automatically makes him very huggable. He's made out of a really soft and smooth material, and is stuffed the <b>perfect</b> amount. He's firm enough that he keeps his shape well, but not so firm that he feels like a fabric-covered rock, and not so soft that he's floppy or squishy.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Interesting: 10/10</b> - Palkia's design is interesting, but doesn't have so many little details that it's overwhelming. A great balance of aesthetics.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Details: 10/10</b> - All of Palkia's little markings and details (especially on his arms and chest) are present on this plushie, and they all look great. One really neat thing is that different parts of him are made of different materials, which really adds a lot of depth to the plushie (the purple markings on his neck, feet, and tail are made out of a rubbery/leathery material, his wings are made out of a thick, rough, and somewhat floppy material, and the pearls on his shoulders are actually a bit shiny). His limbs and wings are also surprisingly flexible and movable.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Construction: 10/10</b> - All the stitching is really solid - he's definitely not coming apart any time soon. His limbs and stuff don't flop around - he's stuffed enough that he keeps his shape well.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Overall: LITERALLY THE BEST THING/10</b> - This Palkia is <i>by far</i> the best plushie I've seen in my life. There's absolutely nothing bad about him that I can think of at all.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Would I recommend this? </b>ABSOLUTELY <b><i>YES!!!!!!!!!</i></b> PALKIA IS THE BEST THING EVER</p></li>

				<li><p><b>Made by: </b>Pokémon Center - <b>Height: </b>11.5in</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Cuddly: 9/10</b> - He's a bit small, but his cuddliness more than makes up for it. The material he's made out of isn't just smooth fabric, it's extremely soft, and looks and feels like fur. He is also the perfect amount of squish - firm enough that he keeps his shape well, but soft enough that he's really cuddly.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Interesting: 10/10</b> - Zekrom is an incredibly unique and strange Pokémon design. He has a bit of an interesting mechanical/robotic look to him, without being too different from other Pokémon.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Details: 10/10</b> - Zekrom is the best looking plushie I have. All of the lines, shading, and details on him are neatly embroidered (not just stickers or paint), and all of the stitches are well hidden. He is extremely detailed, which is especially impressive because of his small size and intricate design. Different parts of him are made out of different materials just like Palkia, which makes him more visually interesting.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Construction: 9/10</b> - Only one complaint: because of his size, his arms and shoulders are very small, so his arms are kinda floppy. Other than that, he feels very solid. The stitching definitely isn't coming apart any time soon, and all the details are very neat and clean.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Overall: 9/10</b> - I can see why everyone loves Pokémon Center plushies now. Zekrom is incredibly cuddly, well-made, and nice-looking, especially for his size.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Would I recommend this? </b>Very much! One of the better plushies I've seen. I don't have any big complaints at all.</p></li>

				<li><p><b>Made by: </b>Tomy - <b>Height: </b>8.5in</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Cuddly: 7/10</b> - Very soft fur, and almost the perfect amount of squish, but his body is a bit too small to hug.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Interesting: 6/10</b> - While he is just a cat, I really like his colors and markings.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Details: 9/10</b> - The embroidery and stitching is fantastic, and his tail is long and has that weird little thing at the end. I really don't like how disproportionately large his head is, though. I hope Tomy doesn't start doing this for all their plushies.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Construction: 10/10</b> - As mentioned before, all the details are fantastic, and he's almost the perfect amount of squish (a bit too squishy for me, though). Everything feels very solid.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Overall: 8.5/10</b> - I love almost everything about this cute little guy, except for the strange, disproportionate head and body sizes.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Would I recommend this? </b>Yes - he's a cute little cat that everyone can love.</p></li>

			<h3 id="arceus">Arceus</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><p><b>Made by: </b>Tomy - <b>Height: </b>9in</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Cuddly: 1/10</b> - Too small, and too many little pointy details to be huggable at all.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Interesting: 10/10</b> - One of the more intricate designs, Arceus just looks cool.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Details: 10/10</b> - Arceus has a lot of weird little details and pointy things, and they are all present and nice-looking on this plushie.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Construction: 6/10</b> - He's pretty flimsy (especially his legs), probably because he's so small. He doesn't feel like he'll come apart at all though, which is good.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Overall: 6/10</b> - This Arceus is a limited-edition anniversary thing that a friend picked up for me. Too many little and pointy details make him not very cuddly or solid. He's definitely more for display than hugs. That is an inherent flaw with Arceus himself though, he just isn't a very plushie-able design.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Would I recommend this? </b>Only if you're a big Arceus fan and/or content with a plushie that's just for display. Otherwise, I can't recommend him.</p></li>

			<h3 id="froakie">Froakie</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><p><b>Made by: </b>Tomy - <b>Height: </b>7.5in</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Cuddly: 6/10</b> - He's certainly soft enough to hug, but is just way too small to cuddle with at all.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Interesting: 4/10</b> - There's not a lot more to say than he's just a foamy frog with a big head. More interesting than a regular frog, I guess.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Details: 7/10</b> - As always, the embroidery and stitching is really nice, but his eyes are weirdly tilted (but now I'm getting pretty nitpicky). I really like how the foamy bits are softer and made out of a different material.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Construction: 10/10</b> - Like all of the other Tomy plushies, he's very well made in general, and won't come apart any time soon. I've actually had this Froakie for a few years, and he's still just as nice as when I got him (he got a little dirty though, but that's not his fault).</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Overall: 6/10</b> - A nice overall plushie, but he just isn't that huggable.</p></li>
				<li><p><b>Would I recommend this? </b>If you picked Froakie as your starter and/or are a fan of Froakie (like me), than I would recommend him. But if you're just looking for another cuddly thing (also like me), than I can't really recommend him.</p></li>
