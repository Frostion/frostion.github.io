								<p>⚠️ yo, if you happen to have the original CD that came with the mylo com-2 or any other relevant files saved on an old hard drive somewhere, please <a href="mailto:acrennie@gmail.com">let me know</a>! i'm trying to collect and preserve as many mylo resources as possible.</p>
								<h2>overview</h2>
								<p>the sony mylo ("my life online") is a series of handheld devices focused around portable web access, instant messaging, and media playback. these aren't smartphones though, as these connect to the internet via wi-fi instead of cellular. sony developed two models of the mylo - the original com-1, and the much improved com-2, which adds custom widget support, a touchscreen, a built-in camera, upgraded wi-fi connectivity, and a variety of other improvements. the com-2 is the model that i own, so that's the one i'll primarily be referring to here.</p>
								<p>these gadgets are a perfect representation of the state of portable tech in the late 2000s. web 2.0 had taken the world by storm at this time - everyone was obsessed with instant messaging, online games, and multimedia, so the idea of being able to access that stuff on the go with a pocket-sized device was super enticing. unlike nowadays, smartphones weren't all that popular yet and cellular data plans were painfully expensive, so a portable wi-fi web communicator device that used free public wi-fi hotspots made perfect sense!</p>
								<p>the mylo was only ever intended to be a portable web browser and media player, so running custom software isn't something it was ever concerned with. the original com-1 had no way of running extra software at all, but the com-2 let users download custom widgets that could then be placed onto a blank, desktop-like screen (very much like android). the mylo came preloaded with a few basic widgets, such as a google search bar, RSS reader, and facebook notifier, and sony encouraged users to develop and share their own homebrew widgets too.</p>

					<h2>developing new mylo widgets</h2>
					<p>as mentioned earlier, the mylo com-2 is able to run custom widgets. unfortunately, all widget development information has vanished from the web by now, but i was able to <a href="/journal/?p=2022.08.15">reverse engineer a sudoku widget</a> that i found on an old, defunct mylo forum. i've put together a <a href="dev.html">short guide</a> on developing your own simple widgets using my findings.</p>
