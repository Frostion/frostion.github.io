					<h1>sony vaio pcv-w30</h1>

					<img class="float" src="01.jpg"></img>
					<p>the sony vaio pcv-w30 is <i>the coolest computer of all time</i>. its otherworldly, all-in-one design and crazy folding keyboard make it seem like it's from another universe (which it probably is). this is my "daily driver" machine - it's not <i>super</i> powerful (and can't be upgraded too much due to being an all-in-one), but it's more totally fine for my computing purposes.</p>
					<p>much like most vaio computers, this was designed to be an all-in-one multimedia experience. the display is super crisp and bright with beautiful colors that put most other LCD monitors to shame. the built-in speakers are also fantastic - most devices' built-in speakers are painfully quiet and tinny, but these sound like good desktop computer speakers while being way smaller and built-in. they're good enough that i'll use it as a CD boombox when working on stuff around the house. it really lives up to its Video Audio Integrated Operation name (that's actually what vaio stands for).</p>
